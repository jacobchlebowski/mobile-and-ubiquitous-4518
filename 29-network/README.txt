This assignment allows you to seamlessly interact with four request functionalities:
GET,PUT,POST, and DELETE. We created this simple program for easy implementation for
our final project.


NOTE: In order to test this project, you MUST run the python3 server.py by going
into bash (for example). Type "python3 server.py" to start the server within the correct directory, 
then interact with the widgets in Android Studio.

NOTE: Open Logcat (Logcat Error) for helpful information upon interacting with the widgets.

NOTE: Under each (POST,PUT,DELETE) you MUST input ONE ID and ONE VALUE respective to that ID. Do NOT
include brackets/parenthesis. See the capture video for reference.


Requirements Satisfied:
-Our project has a unique name("p_network")
-Our Android project is NOT a direct copy and paste of the Network demo. While our project uses some implementations (such as the server), we do NOT use retrofit (from the demo) and we have changed the server (server.py) significantly.
-Our app provides the feature of retrieving information via HTTP GET from a web service (REST API) and automatically converts the JSON literal to Kotlin objects (see in MainActivity.kt). We correctly display the Kotlin objects in the UI.
-Our app provides the features of updating the information managed by the RESTful web service via HTTP POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.
-The user can interact with the app to trigger the four types of HTTP requests, and the app can display the resulting information in the UI.
-Created a screen recording that shows the Android device's UI changes and the backend server's state changes.


OPTIONAL Satisfied:
-Designed and implemented a UI that allows users to perform the four HTTP requests seamlessly with interactions that ALLOW you to SELECT DELETE, POST, PUT, and GET. See "Intuitive UI design write-up.pdf" for the full write up.
