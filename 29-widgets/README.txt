Simple Calculator. Our application satisfies the following requirements:
-Our project has a reasonably unique name: "Simple Calculator"
-Three different types of widgets (Button, TextView, ImageView)
-Our button widgets respond appropriately via event listeners attached. Our buttons in our calculator respond to user interactions by displaying in our "equation" or "answer" TextView when pressed.
-Our widgets have different apprearances from the ones with default styles. Our widgets display a black background and white text inside the button.
-We support two XML layouts, one for landscape and one for portrait mode. We have two seperate xml files that satisfy this requirement.
