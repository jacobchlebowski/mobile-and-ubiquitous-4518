Sweat Life application "Intent" assignment. Our application satisfies the necessary requirements.

Sweat Life will be our final project and we will continue to add onto this application. Our application 
satisfies the requirements.

- "Sweat Life" is a unique application name
- We have at least two activities. Our total of three activities include MainActivity, SecondActivity, and ThirdActivity.
- All three of our activities have different layouts and aren't alike.


Intent:

Our MainActivity completes the parent to child intent. The user types into an EditText widget which is
the respective data that is being sent from MainActivity to ThirdActivity. In this case, the date is the
data. In the child_to_parent.webm recording, the intent is correctly sent/received between the two
activities.

Our second piece of data being sent is in the child to parent intent. The user clicks on a genre,
in this case upper body, and selects the respective upper body workout to be their favorite. Once
favorite button is clicked on the SecondActivity screen, an intent with the workout data is sent
to the MainActivity in which it displays the workout that was favorited.


Finally, the navigation workflow fits with our application. It's easy to navigate between all three
of our pages (MainActivity, SecondActivity, ThirdActivity). The Second and Third Activity also have
"return" buttons that allows you to return to the MainActivity screen.
