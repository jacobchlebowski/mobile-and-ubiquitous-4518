Recycler View

We've added RecyclerView onto our final project assignment we intend to turn in.


NOTE: Our activity_third.xml contains our RecyclerView (our item XML layout pertains to each item in the RecyclerView List)


Requirements satisfied:
-Our project has a unique name "SweatLife"
-Our Android project is NOT a direct copy and paste of RecyclerView (you can see for yourself in our XML code)


-Our RecyclerView and its item layout design are designed to make it easy to verify the two scenarios:
	1) The RecyclerView can display 20 initial items (as seen in the capture video included in this ZIP folder)
	2) The RecyclerView can respond to newly added data as seen in the capture video (handles dynamic data)

-Our item XML layout ( item.xml ) contains 2 widgets (1 being TextView 1 being a Button)

-The item button widget responds to a user click by providing a toast

NOTE: The delete button for now displays a toast, but in the future will actually remove the date (for our final project!)
